Compiling: git clone, set up for automake (I have not looked closely enough at how automake works but running 'autoreconf -i' seems to do the job), then build with ./configure and make.

Simpler option: The program does not use any qt libraries but I use qtcreator to work on it. Open the .proj file with qtcreator!

The program compiles fine on linux including raspberry pi.


1. GCX uses the GTK+2.0 software tool kit which is no longer maintained. Depending on your themes some visual aspects work poorly.

2. AAVSO report: Only ENSEMBLE photometry. In the recipe file or the staredit dialog, set target and check stars by using the star comments field: "target_something" will match with "check_something" (star type must be photometry target). All targets in the feild will be reported.

The AAVSO fields GROUP, CHART or COMMENTS are not set (yet) so they need to be edited if required.

3. There are problems with loading/modifying/saving reports and recipes.

4. Much more can be done on indi/indigo interface to telescope.
