Compiling: git clone, set up for automake, then build with ./configure and make.

Or: The program does not use any qt libraries but I use qtcreator to work on it. Use the .proj file with qtcreator.  

1. GCX uses the GTK+2.0 software tool kit which is no longer maintained. More modern themes don't work well with it. 
For best results, launch GCX with a GTK2 theme something like this:

    GTK2_RC_FILES=/usr/share/themes/Greybird/gtk-2.0/gtkrc gcx

2. Set up for AAVSO report: in the recipe, or staredit, set target and check stars in the star comments field: "target_something" will match with "check_something"
