# gcx-1.5

GCX attempts to be a complete solution for capturing astronomical images (using indi or indigo), processing them and doing stellar photometry ready for submission to AAVSO.

This is a fork of of the original gcx-1.5 that is no longer available on github. I have removed some bugs that made the original unworkable.
